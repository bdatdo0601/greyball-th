# Live Change Tracker Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The live change tracker was showing a deletion change of the entire document when first loading, which was a false positive caused by initialization issues.

## Root Cause
The problem was in the change detection logic where:
1. The `lastContent.current` reference was initialized with the original HTML content
2. When TipTap first processed the content, it might normalize or reformat the HTML slightly
3. The diff algorithm would detect this as a deletion of the entire document and replacement with new content

## Fix Applied

### 1. Enhanced Change Detection Logic
- **Added debug logging** to track what's happening during change detection
- **Added false positive detection** to skip changes that look like initialization issues
- **Added filtering** to prevent large deletions/replacements (>80% of document) from being tracked

### 2. Improved Initialization Sequence
- **Updated editor onCreate callback** to properly initialize `lastContent.current` with the editor's actual HTML
- **Enhanced debugging** to track content differences between initial and editor-processed content
- **Better sequencing** of initialization to prevent race conditions

### 3. Safeguards Against Large Changes
The change detection now includes these safety checks:

```typescript
// Skip likely false positives during initialization
const isLikelyFalsePositive = 
  oldText.length > 1000 && 
  currentText.length < 100 && 
  !currentText.trim();

// Filter out changes that would affect most of the document
const filteredChanges = changes.filter(change => {
  if (change.type === "delete" && change.length > oldText.length * 0.8) return false;
  if (change.type === "replace" && change.length > oldText.length * 0.8) return false;
  return true;
});
```

### 4. Debug Logging Added
Added console logging to help diagnose issues:
- Content length comparisons during initialization
- Change detection process details  
- Large change filtering warnings

## Expected Behavior Now

1. **On Document Load**: No false positive changes should appear
2. **During Editing**: Only actual user changes should be tracked
3. **Large Edits**: Genuine large edits will still be tracked, but initialization artifacts will be filtered out

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Load a document in the editor
2. Verify no changes appear in the tracker initially
3. Make small edits and verify they're tracked correctly
4. Make large edits and verify they're tracked appropriately
5. Check browser console for debug information during the process

## Debug Information
The fix includes debug logging that can be monitored in the browser console:
- "Component initialization:" - Shows initial setup
- "Editor onCreate:" - Shows what happens when editor is ready
- "Change Detection Debug:" - Shows text comparison details
- Various warning messages for filtered changes

This should resolve the issue where the entire document was showing as deleted when first loading the editor.
